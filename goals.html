    <h2>Current Education Goals</h2>
    <p>My current work goals are to secure my degree in CS, <br>
        Computer Science, and then my bachelor's degree in <br>
        Computer Information Systems (CIS).  I also plan to stay <br>
        learning more, since the computer science industry keeps<br>
        growing, as technology keeps on advancing.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Current Work Goals</h2>
    <p>As I am currently working to finish my education, my goal <br>
        is to get an internship or work related study job at a  <br>
        major company.  I am excited to have on the job training,  <br>
        to use and sharpen my computer skills.  Engulfing myself <br>
        in the working environment is the best way to do this.  Also, <br>
        it would help to make more money while doing work I am <br>
        passionate about.
