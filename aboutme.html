    <h2>Student. Employee. Weight Lifter.</h2>
    <p>I have worked since I was 16 years old.  Now that <br>
        I am thinking about it, my first job was at a <br>
        warehouse, and I am currently working at Amazon, <br>
        a company with a slew of warehouses.  In between, I <br>
        worked in offices in between my first and current jobs.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Thanks to my current job paying for my college studies, <br>
        I am able to go to school to pursue my degree in <br>
        computer science.  I also can thank my job for allowing <br>
        me additional time to study away from work.
